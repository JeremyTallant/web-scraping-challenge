# Mission to Mars: A Web-Scraping Journey
## Background
This project presents a sophisticated web application designed to bring the forefront of Martian exploration directly to your screen. By harnessing the capabilities of Python, the application meticulously scrapes various scientific websites to gather the latest data on Mars missions. The back-end foundation is built with Flask, a micro web framework that efficiently routes and renders the collected data. At the same time, MongoDB serves as the backbone for data storage, ensuring that the information is current and persistently available. The result is a user-friendly platform that educates and inspires by providing up-to-the-minute insights into our neighboring planet's exploration with the convenience of a single, intuitive interface.
